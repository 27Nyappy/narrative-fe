## What is Narrative?

Narrative is a full-stack application designed to help storytellers, story writers, screenwriters, novelists, and others keep track of their ideas! Whether you're building new stories, developing characters, chapters, worlds, or locations, Narrative is a safe place to store your ideas and organize your thoughts.

## How It's Built

Narrative is a full-stack web application, with the backend built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB for our database management and API. User information is stored in our MongoDB database, and fetched according to specific user, story, chapter, world, character, and location identifiers. 

The frontend of the application is built using React and Redux. Information on the frontend is stored both in local state, as well as Redux state depending on the application's needs. User authentication and login is handled via Firebase, and input fields for users is handled via Quill. 

## Our Team

This application was made at Alchemy Code Lab by: Antonella Gutierrez, Donna Lambert, Ollie Hill, and Alex Spencer.
